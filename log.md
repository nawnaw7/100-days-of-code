**Started on September 7th, Thursday, 2017**

# Log

### Day 1: September 7, Thursday

**Progress**: I've gone through the basic algorithms on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the section.

**Thoughts** The JS algorithms seem less difficalt than before. Awesome feeling.

### Day 2: September 8, Friday

**Progress**: Worked on my FCC Weather App. Changed the size of the pictures for a faster loading time. Added an information pannel which makes the overall header look much better than before. 

**Thoughts**: I'm quite happy for how my app looks now. :D

### Day 3: September 9, Saturday

**Progress**: Started a new FCC project - Using the Twitch.tv API - and managed to do a UI sketch, using [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) (first time).

**Thoughts**: It took me a lot of time to start this projects because I had no ideas on how to style the user interface. I like materialize css so far and I think that the app will look great in the end. ^^

### Day 4: September 10, Sunday

**Progress**: Implement the Twitch.tv API calls......work still in progress.

**Thoughts**: I still think this project is the most annoying one. It is frustrating that I need 2 api calls, one for getting the streaming status (online, offline) and one for getting channel data (because the first query doesn't return any data for offline users)....I hate hardcoding stuff, but with this project I can't seem to escape it....><

### Day 5: September 11, Monday

**Progress**: Finished the FCC 4th intermediate JavaScript project - Use the Twitch.tv API...Managed to do only 1 API call and get all the info I needed ;D

**Thouhgts**: Feels good to be over with this. After yesterday's frustrations, today's work went fairly smoothly. I managed to do what I wanted with less than I thought was neccessary. My JS file is so small and well structured xD (1 JSON call and 1 callback function with an if/else inside)...

### Day 6: September 12, Tuesday

**Progress**: Started with the Intermediate JavaScript Algorithms. Done two of them and I got tired....xD 
Also started reading Eloquent Javascript and continued with the Complete Web Developer Course (Rob Percival, Udemy)! ^^

**Thoughts**: Well, they sure are a bit more difficult than the basic ones. The first algorithm was more or less easy, but the second one gave me a bit of a headache... I figured it out in the end though....

2. [Diff Two Arrays](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/diff-two-arrays)


### Day 7: September 13, Wednesday

**Progress**: Finished the MySQL section from Rob Percival's course 'The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0' (Udemy) and done some changes/optimizations to my Wikipedia Viewer (buttons, footer, fade in effect on cards). Want to implement a 'load more' button as well (maybe tomorrow?)...

**Thoughts**: The MySQL last project was a bit confusing, but I definitely need more practice. On the other hand, I love working on my projects. I was really tired today and wanted to quit after finishing studying, but then I started to do a few little changes on my Wiki Viewer and I ended up working a lot more on it than I previously wanted...It's always like that xD

### Day 8: September 14, Thursday

**Progress**: I was a little busy today with creating resumes and work profiles...I am officially doing job hunting starting today! xD Hopefully, soon enough I'll be working as a Junior Front End Developer! ^^
Nevertheless, I managed to do two algorithms.

**Thoughts**: The algorithms sure are getting harder, but I am learning things I didn't know could be possible in JavaScript.

2. [Wherefore art thou](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/wherefore-art-thou)


### Day 9: September 15, Friday

**Progress**: More algorithms today...

**Thoughts**: I miss working on a project....Thinking about starting the JS calculator soon. ><

2. [Pig Latin](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/pig-latin)


### Day 10: September 16, Saturnday

**Progress**: Done some MySQL and read a bit about JS closures and from the book Eloquent JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: MySQL/PHP are quite confusing for the moment...I hope they'll get clearer later...

### Day 11: September 17, Sunday

**Progress**: Learned SASS (SCSS)! I'll definitely implement it in ym projects from now on!

**Thouhgts**: Man, this SASS thing is awesome (as its name states)...I never thought you could add so much logic to style sheets.

### Day 12: September 18, Monday

**Progress**: Finished the API section from the Udemy 'Complete Web Developer Course' + started working on my Portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Nothing especially new. I've done most of these things when I worked on my Weather App. Also, I want to create a cool z-index parallax as the header of my portfolio. ^^

### Day 13: September 19, Tuesday

**Progress**: Experimented with Multilayer Parallax, using CSS and JavaScript, and I actually made it work. 

**Thoughts**: I always thought that this feature looked awesome and fancy (but complicated). I'm really glad I learned how to do it (at least partially, on the Y axis). I'm going to implement this in my Portfolio website.

### Day 14: September 20, Wednesday

**Progress**: Didn't do much today. I only worked a bit on my Portfolio project but haven't really advanced an idea...

**Thoughts**: I felt kind of exhausted and overwhelmed/disappointed today....I hope that tomorrow will be better.

### Day 15: September 21, Thursday

**Progress**: Learned about creating mobile apps with App.js. Also, I'm postponing my portfolio project due to a lack of interesting ideas.

**Thoughts**: Creating HTML/CSS/JS mobile apps is not that difficult apparently. I might try making one if the idea sparks. xD

**Link(s)**: -


### Day 16: September 22, Friday

**Progress**: Learned more about mobile apps. Learned about local storage with Javascript and how to deploy an app to various stores. Also, learned about HTML canvas + practiced a little.

**Thoughts**: The canvas is really powerful. I must continue studying it and practicing, since you can do so many amazing things with it + it's Javascript :D

### Day 17: September 23, Saturday

**Progress**: Almost finished with the Complete Web Dev Course. Also, played a bit with parallaxes and photoshop and canvas.

**Thoughts**: Wanna finish this course and start learning about Vue. I can't wait to be able to use it.

**Link(s)**: -


### Day 18: September 24, Sunday

**Progress**: Did a clock face today with canvas. I only have the python section left from the Complete Web Dev Course....gonna finish it tomorrow than start learning Vue.

**Thoughts**: The clock face exercise was fun. I also implemented a digital clock (at my dad's *fun* suggestion)...Can't wait tp start learning Vue.

### Day 19: September 25, Monday

**Progress**: I finally finished with the Complete Web Developer Course. I started the Vue.js course and I'm definitely enjoying it so far.

**Thoughts**: I's been a long ride, but it was worth it. I learned many things from this course, when it comes to PHP and mysql. I could probably try creating (having fun) with a basic wordpress theme just for practice.

### Day 20: September 26, Tuesday

**Progress**: Started a new course - Vue JS 2, The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex) - and I'm loving it so far. Did the first exercises too and they were fairly easy but entertaining.

**Thoughts**: Vue.js is awesome. I can't wait to learn more and apply it in my projects. (Side note: Max's accent is kind of cute xD...)

### Day 21: September 27, Wednesday

**Progress**: Continued with the Vue.js course and done event listeners.

**Thoughts**: Event listeners and their manipulation is much easier with Vue than, say, with JS (obviously xD). I'm kind of sad because I'm a bit too busy these days and I don't have as much time as I would like to learn Vue....

### Day 22: September 28, Thursday

**Progress**: Finished the fist section of the Vue.js course - DOM manipulation - and learned about passin CSS classes with Vue, reading and manipulating users' inputs + computed properties and the watch 'ability'.

**Thoughts**: Vue really makes things much easier when it comes to user inputs and dynamically changing content...Loving it! <3

### Day 23: September 29, Friday

**Progress**: Did more Vue today. Things got more complicated but not impossible to understand. Finished the first section of the course (DOM manipulation).

**Thoughts**: Can't wait to continue tomorrow. Once I know enough Vue, I'm going to implement it in all my FCC projects. ;D
