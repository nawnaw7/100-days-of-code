**Started on September 7th, Thursday, 2017**

# Log

### Day 1: September 7, Thursday

**Progress**: I've gone through the basic algorithms on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the section.

**Thoughts** The JS algorithms seem less difficalt than before. Awesome feeling.

### Day 2: September 8, Friday

**Progress**: Worked on my FCC Weather App. Changed the size of the pictures for a faster loading time. Added an information pannel which makes the overall header look much better than before. 

**Thoughts**: I'm quite happy for how my app looks now. :D

### Day 3: September 9, Saturday

**Progress**: Started a new FCC project - Using the Twitch.tv API - and managed to do a UI sketch, using [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) (first time).

**Thoughts**: It took me a lot of time to start this projects because I had no ideas on how to style the user interface. I like materialize css so far and I think that the app will look great in the end. ^^

### Day 4: September 10, Sunday

**Progress**: Implement the Twitch.tv API calls......work still in progress.

**Thoughts**: I still think this project is the most annoying one. It is frustrating that I need 2 api calls, one for getting the streaming status (online, offline) and one for getting channel data (because the first query doesn't return any data for offline users)....I hate hardcoding stuff, but with this project I can't seem to escape it....><

### Day 5: September 11, Monday

**Progress**: Finished the FCC 4th intermediate JavaScript project - Use the Twitch.tv API...Managed to do only 1 API call and get all the info I needed ;D

**Thouhgts**: Feels good to be over with this. After yesterday's frustrations, today's work went fairly smoothly. I managed to do what I wanted with less than I thought was neccessary. My JS file is so small and well structured xD (1 JSON call and 1 callback function with an if/else inside)...

### Day 6: September 12, Tuesday

**Progress**: Started with the Intermediate JavaScript Algorithms. Done two of them and I got tired....xD 
Also started reading Eloquent Javascript and continued with the Complete Web Developer Course (Rob Percival, Udemy)! ^^

**Thoughts**: Well, they sure are a bit more difficult than the basic ones. The first algorithm was more or less easy, but the second one gave me a bit of a headache... I figured it out in the end though....

### Day 7: September 13, Wednesday

**Progress**: Finished the MySQL section from Rob Percival's course 'The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0' (Udemy) and done some changes/optimizations to my Wikipedia Viewer (buttons, footer, fade in effect on cards). Want to implement a 'load more' button as well (maybe tomorrow?)...

**Thoughts**: The MySQL last project was a bit confusing, but I definitely need more practice. On the other hand, I love working on my projects. I was really tired today and wanted to quit after finishing studying, but then I started to do a few little changes on my Wiki Viewer and I ended up working a lot more on it than I previously wanted...It's always like that xD

### Day 8: September 14, Thursday

**Progress**: I was a little busy today with creating resumes and work profiles...I am officially doing job hunting starting today! xD Hopefully, soon enough I'll be working as a Junior Front End Developer! ^^
Nevertheless, I managed to do two algorithms.

**Thoughts**: The algorithms sure are getting harder, but I am learning things I didn't know could be possible in JavaScript.

### Day 9: September 15, Friday

**Progress**: More algorithms today...

**Thoughts**: I miss working on a project....Thinking about starting the JS calculator soon. ><

### Day 10: September 16, Saturnday

**Progress**: Done some MySQL and read a bit about JS closures and from the book Eloquent JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: MySQL/PHP are quite confusing for the moment...I hope they'll get clearer later...

### Day 11: September 17, Sunday

**Progress**: Learned SASS (SCSS)! I'll definitely implement it in ym projects from now on!

**Thouhgts**: Man, this SASS thing is awesome (as its name states)...I never thought you could add so much logic to style sheets.
